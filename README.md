**PREDICTING SELLING PRICES OF HOUSES IN SEATTLE, USA**

W5 - PROJECT

The structure of the repo created for this project is robust.
The README file elaborately defines the purpose of the
project, talks briefly about the methodology used to build the
model and the structure of the repo is also clear. The use of
semantic names is abundant, making very clever choices to
economize steps and optimize understanding.

Project details - regression

**Background**: For a real estate company, build a machine learning model to predict the selling prices of houses based on a variety of features on which the value of the house is evaluated.

**Objective**: The task is to build a model that will predict the price of a house based on features provided in the dataset. The senior management also wants to explore the characteristics of the houses using some business intelligence tool. One of those parameters include understanding which factors are responsible for higher property value - \$650K and above.

**Data**: The data set consists of information on some 22,000 properties. Â The dataset consisted of historic data of houses sold between May 2014 to May 2015.

### Exploring the data

We encourage you to thoroughly understand your data and take the necessary steps to prepare your data for modeling before building exploratory or predictive models. Since this is a classification model, you can use linear regression for classification for building a model. You are also encouraged to use other models in your project including KNN, decision trees for regression.
To explore the data, you can use the techniques that have been discussed in class. Some of them include using the describe method, checking null values, using _matplotlib_ and _seaborn_ for developing visualizations.
The data has a number of categorical and numerical variables. Explore the nature of data for these variables before you start with the data cleaning process and then data pre-processing (scaling numerical variables and encoding categorical variables).
You will also use tableau to visually explore the data further.

### Model

Use different models to compare the accuracies and find the model that best fits your data. You can use the measures of accuracies that have been discussed in class. Please note that while comparing different models, make sure you use the same measure of accuracy as a benchmark.
